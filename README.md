# Play-Store-App-Review
**Introduction**- Google Play, also branded as the Google Play Store and formerly Android Market, is  a digital distribution service operated and developed by Google.  
It serves as the official app store for certified devices running on Android and its  derivatives as well as Chrome OS, allowing users to browse and download  applications developed with the Android software development kit (SDK) and  published through Google.  
Google Play also serves as a digital media store, offering music, books, movies, and  television programs. Content purchased on Google Play Movies & TV  and Google Play Books can be accessed on a web browser and through the Android  and iOS apps.

**Problem statement**- The problem statement is to analyze the data of the play store app. Why is it more  successful as compared to another source from the E-worlds? Play store has gotten great  attention day by day as it's one platform that consists of different types of apps and also  considers the size, category, reviews, size, installs, type, price, recent updates, and last  update. 

 **Data summary**-The app from the play store is mainly classified by categorical type of data in which we do  the EDA on each app by categorical value.  
The approach in this we have to group by features of the app that give us the major  aspects. The most critical in this project is dealing with the mixture of data which means it  consists of string types of data The approach behind this makes data type of  numerical feature into float. This will help us in the analysis of these features. 

**Conclusion**- The conclusion from the entire project is to handle data with care. A single mistake or  unconsciousness regarding data will get into more trouble, it will happen like just  stuck into maize. So take each step with more and more care. 
We all work with different datasets containing reviews, ratings, and all other  features. We get some insights for working on real-world projects. We fill first  missing value and do the base part cleaning, then from that, we go with  visualization on different datasets.
